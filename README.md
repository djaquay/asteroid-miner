## Notes

Fully craft a ship.

Had thoughts about more granular drops, e.g. "mechanical parts", "electrical parts", etc., but then
also "specialized parts A", "B", "C", etc.  Research on how to *make* these parts could consume the
original parts, and require some number of them to complete, causing the player to choose whether
to use the parts e.g. to fix his ship, or to sort out how to make them himself.
